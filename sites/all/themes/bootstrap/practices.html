<p>The National Standards of Practice are a set of guidelines for home and property inspectors to follow in the
    performance of their inspections. They are the most widely accepted Canadian home inspection guidelines in use, and
    address all the home’s major systems and components. The National Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics are
    recognized by many related professionals as the definitive Standards for professional performance in the
    industry. </p>
<p>These National Standards of Practice are being published to inform the public on the nature and scope of visual
    building inspections performed by home and property inspectors who are members of the Canadian Association of Home
    and Property Inspectors (CAHPI). </p>
<p>The purpose of the National Standards of Practice is to provide guidelines for home and property inspectors regarding
    both the inspection itself and the drafting of the inspection report, and to define certain terms relating to the
    performance of home inspections to ensure consistent interpretation. </p>
<p>To ensure better public protection, home and property inspectors who are members of CAHPI should strive to meet these
    Standards and abide by the appropriate provincial/regional CAHPI Code of Ethics. </p>
<p>These Standards take into account that a visual inspection of a building does not constitute an evaluation or a
    verification of compliance with building codes, Standards or regulations governing the construction industry or the
    health and safety industry, or Standards and regulations governing insurability. </p>
<p>Any terms not defined in these Standards shall have the meaning commonly assigned to it by the various trades and
    professions, according to context.</p>

<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3></dt>

<dt>1.1</dt>
<dd>The Canadian Association of Home and Property Inspectors (CAHPI) is a not-for-profit association whose members
    include the following seven
    provincial/regional organizations: CAHPI-British
    Columbia., CAHPI-Alberta, CAHPI-Saskatchewan,
    CAHPI-Manitoba, OAHI (Ontario), AIBQ (Quebec),
    and CAHPI-Atlantic. CAHPI strives to promote
    excellence within the profession and continual
    improvement of inspection services to the public.
</dd>
<dt>
<h3>2. PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3></dt>
<dt>2.1</dt>
<dd>The purpose of these National Standards
    of Practice is to establish professional and
    uniform Standards for private, fee-paid home
    inspectors who are members of one of the
    provincial/regional organizations of CAHPI.
    Home Inspections performed to these National
    Standards of Practice are intended to provide
    information regarding the condition of the
    systems and components of the building as
    inspected at the time of the Home Inspection.
    This does NOT include building code inspections.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These National Standards of Practice enable the
    building being inspected to be compared with
    a building that was constructed in accordance
    with the generally accepted practices at the time
    of construction, and which has been adequately
    maintained such that there is no significant loss
    of functionality.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It follows that the building may not be in
    compliance with current building codes,
    standards and regulations that are applicable at
    the time of inspection. <br/>
    <br/>
    These National Standards of Practice apply to
    inspections of part or all of a building for the
    following building types:
    <ul>
        <li>single-family dwelling, detached, semidetached
            or row house
        </li>
        <li>multi unit residential building</li>
        <li>residential building held in divided or
            undivided co ownership
        </li>
        <li>residential building occupied in part for
            a residential occupancy and in part for a
            commercial occupancy, as long as the latter
            use does not exceed 40% of the building’s total
            area, excluding the basement.
        </li>
    </ul>
</dd>
<dt>2.2 The Inspector shall:</dt>
<dt>A. inspect</dt>

</dd>
<dt>B. report</dt>
<dd><p>1. on those systems and components installed on
    the building inspected which, in the professional
    opinion or judgement of the inspector, have a
    significant deficiency or are unsafe or are near
    the end of their service lives.</p>

    <p>2. a reason why, if not self-evident, the system or
        component has a significant deficiency or is
        unsafe or is near the end of its service life.</p>

    <p>3. the inspector’s recommendations to correct or
        monitor the reported deficiency.</p>

    <p>4. on any systems and components designated
        for inspection in these National Standards of
        Practice which were present at the time of the
        Home Inspection but were not inspected and a
        reason they were not inspected.</p></dd>
<dt>2.3 These National Standards of Practice are not
    intended to limit inspectors from:
</dt>

    to those required by these National Standards of
    Practice provided the inspector is appropriately
    qualified and willing to do so.</p>
